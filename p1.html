<h2>Introduction to Programming Languages</h2>
Want to one day become a software engineer? Want to also create a mobile app that people around the world would love to use? Are you passionate enough to take the big step of getting into the programming world? Then you are in the right spot, as you will get a quick introduction to programming through this post. You have to learn what a machine is first, before we understand what programming is. A computer is a system capable of taking human instruction, processing it, and reacting to it, or a computer is a computing device used by a computer program to process the data. Program is an instruction sequence along with data.. a  program is a set of instructions given to a computer to perform a specific operation. or computer is a computational device which is used to process the data under the control of a computer program.While executing the program, raw data is processed into a desired output format. These computer programs are written in a programming language which are high level languages. High level languages are nearly human languages which are more complex then the computer understandable language which are called machine language, or low level language.So after knowing the basics, we are ready to create a very simple and basic program. Like we have different languages to communicate with each other, likewise, we have different languages like C, C++, C#, Java, python, etc to communicate with the computers. The computer only understands binary language (the language of 0’s and 1’s) also called machine-understandable language or low-level language but the programs we are going to write are in a high-level language which is almost similar to human language
