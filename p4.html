When you're a newbie in software development, the very first thing that comes to mind is "Where to start? "It's definitely true. There are hundreds to choose from, but how are you going to figure out that yeah, that's the one? Which will suit you most, your interests, and your career goals? Listening to what the market says, where the tech trend is headed, is one of the simplest ways to choose the best programming language to learn for 2019.At the very end, you’ll be having a clear picture of which programming languages can help your career boost in upcoming years and beyond that . Let’s dive in
	<h2>java :-</h2>

JavaScript is predominantly lightweight, interpreted, and plays an important role in the development of the front end. Even some of the major social media platforms believe that JavaScript provides a smooth and career-driven way to create interactive Web pages.
The popularity of Java helps to ensure its future popularity, thanks to a huge community of users. With massive Stack Overflow and GitHub communities, developers can find help on virtually any problem they might encounter. Coupled with its portability, developers know that investing in Java will pay dividends for a long, long time. 
	<h2>c :-</h2>

“Old is gold” – C has proved this quote in different ways. Being introduced in the late 1970s, C has made a strong contribution to the world of programming.C has been the parent language of a handful; some are either derived from C or inspired by its syntax, constructs, and paradigms, including Java, Objective-C, and C#.
Even, nowadays, it is seen, whenever there is a need to build high-performance applications, C remains the most popular choice.Linux OS is C based. And CPP is the hybrid version of C. C++ is an object-oriented programming language and which is built on C; therefore it is preferred over others for designing higher-level applications.C++ is seeing as more performing than dynamically typed languages because the code is type-checked before it is executed on real grounds. Core areas of developments are Virtual Reality, gaming, computer graphics etc.
	<h2>paython:-</h2>

The popularity of Python has risen steadily over the past 15 years, finally breaking the top 5 on the Tiobe Index a few years ago. This is because Python is a major language in some of the most exciting technologies today.Machine learning, artificial intelligence (AI), Big Data, and Robotics all rely heavily on Python (Robotics also relies on C for its use in systems programming). Cyber Security, one of the top software challenges of our time, is also driven by Python.
It’s surprising how simple Python is to learn.It’s now the most popular introductory language taught in universities and often picked up by experienced developers as a second or third language.
	<h2>javascript:-</h2>

Thanks to the ubiquity of web browsers, JavaScript has become one of the most popular programming languages in the world, and number 1 on GitHub in terms of pull requests.There are notable complaints with JavaScript (more on that in a bit), but JavaScript has held its own against newer languages and will continue to play a significant role on the web.JavaScript allows developers to add interactive effects to web pages. It often works alongside HTML, but it’s becoming more common for web apps to be built entirely in JavaScript.
JavaScript is predominantly lightweighed, interpreted and plays an important role in the development of the front end. Even some of the major social media platforms believe that JavaScript provides a smooth and career-driven way to create interactive Web pages.JavaScript is preferred by all major browsers because of its compatibility and is really flexible to the syntax it holds. JavaScript is also used on the server-side by Node.js as a Front-end language. Above all make JavaScript loveliest programming language among the beginners.
